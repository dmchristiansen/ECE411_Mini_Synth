This is a list of the pins on the ATxmega128A1U that are going to be used, and what they're connected to.

Sensor inputs:
  Port A, pins 93 - 99
  93 = GND
  94 = AVcc
  95 = Aref
  96 = Sensor 1
  97 = Sensor 2
  98 = Sensor 3
  99 = Sensor 4


Audio output:
  Port B, pin 7
  (Vcc can be used as Vref for DAC)
  
JTAG: (maybe not needed?)
  Port B, pins 9 - 12
  9 = TMS
  10 = TDI
  11 = TCK
  12 = TDO
  
PDI:
  Port R, pins 89 - 90
  89 = PDI_DATA
  90 = PDI_CLOCK
