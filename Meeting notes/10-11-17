	Discussion:
	- Sensors are ordered
	- Who’s our fifth person?
	- What’s our output like?
	-MIDI vs MP3 (codecs, data size
	- Choice of processor: what proc should we choose? It needs to be able to have a good enough baud rate for playback
		-Do we need a seperate MIDI chip?
	-What language should we program the chip in?
	-What do we want our project to look like? (physically
	-Choice of pads: piezo vs pressure, or both?

Need a better focus on what we our project to do (scope)

Daniel has already ordered a few pieces of equipment

	To do:
	- Test sensors once they arrive
	- Research MIDI synth chips / audio output
	- Research SD card readers & associated requirements
