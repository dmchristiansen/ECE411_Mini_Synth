10/27/2017 - Meeting notes


Agenda:
Any new concerns or developments
SD concern about being able to read from the slot to the microcontroller - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWJCmbmHYRoneed to test
Centralization
Refocusing on what we want our project to be/do based on feedback from lectures and feedback about the PDS
-Tyler: make an exact requirements and performance list for our project
Code for microcontroller needs to be planned for
	Here are some links that might be useful.
This project is closer to our project

Work based scheduling
Balancing work between members (whoâ€™s going to do what from here on out?)
Volunteered work vs specialty assignments
Scheduling
Need to setup milestones, deadlines, etc. based off of M$ project (HW 4)
Retroactive entries
Documentation
Weekly task reports need to be made
Retroactive entries
Revise PDS?
Log and project books?
Refine wiki
Github and versioning control
Need to start utilizing versioning control on github
Does everyone know how to use? 
Do we need to have  a training session to use git?
Need to start putting the Eagle files and our other documentation on to Git
Do we need to start planning for Code?
Prototyping and Testing
Need documentation and plans for testing
Performance requirements
Revision plans
Need finalized layout before Osh Park due date (11/16)
Stages
Components - performance and feedback
Module circuits (blocks from diagrams) - performance and testing
Whole prototype testing
Future developments 
quick study/review for final exam?


General notes:
- Everyone learn git
- Install MS Project

	LiPo Battery 18650 (3.7v) - 
	LiPo Battery Charging IC
https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/skyworks-solutions-inc/AAT3693IDH-AA-T1/863-1512-1-ND/4246137

	Begin keeping change logs
Need RF choke and capacitors to regulate analog Vcc
Daniel has begun test interfacing code for the atmel processor as well as having a prototype circuit for the piezo sensors

Potential sound changing method: Using DC value to vary capacitance and change frequency of waveform via an analog circuit

How do we interpolate several sine waves using a wave table?

Progress Report for Week 5 (10/27/2017)
(5 day)

To do by next week:

Daniel - 
Prototype code for 4-sensor input polling loop.  
Prototype code for wavetable output functionality. 
**look into LED on in output**
Look into register config for 128a1u

Tyler - Design battery power circuit, switching supply with micro usb power in.

Aaron - get prototype of audio amplifier working (ugly construction) and if successful, import to Eagle. Use Gantter on and test compatibility with Project so everyone on the team can work on the project file. Bring 18650 battery. Get 3.3 V zeners at surplus gizmos

Jesse - help with audio amplifier 
	pin outs for the headphone out. 
	Design filter-pad rectifier

Tsegaslase - list of core functionality and requirements 

For All - Do Git tutorial, Get familiarized with Project/Gantt files, reorganize and cleanup  documentation on Drive and Wiki


To do by next week:

Refine layout
Refine block diagram
