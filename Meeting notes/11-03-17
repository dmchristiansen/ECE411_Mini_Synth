What got done / what didn’t

Aaron: 
Amplifier not tested/built due to confusion over single/separate supply for the audio 
	Amplifier.  
2.5 V Zeners obtained (1N5222b). 
LiPo batteries obtained

	NEED to do: design offboard audio amp, design boost converter, finalize schematic

Daniel:
	Prototyped 4-sensor polling loop
	Began prototyping wavetable code
	Still need to find correct pinouts & registers for 128a1u

Tyler:
	Researched battery charging ic
	Still need to select ic and layout on eagle

Jesse:
	SImulated regulator inputs
	Designed headphone out

Tsegaslase:



General Notes

We should keep pretty much everything on github

Also, multiple meeting note files / mirroring the important stuff elsewhere

How do we want to do the filters for the inputs?  A daughter board would simplify our PCB and allow us to adjust component values to better 

Start coding in C, without the Arduino IDE

We need to start thinking about the physical design

What to ask greenberg:
	- Git questions
	- Do we need to be submitting our milestone things?


What’s due by Thursday

Preliminary layout for pcb

To do by next meeting

 Get a working daughter board for Piezo filter and Audio Amp


Aaron:
	Work on boost converter
	Work on audio amplifier

Daniel:
	Write wavetable prototype
	Write polling loop in C
	Find correct pins for 128 uC
	Learn how to use programmer

Jesse:
	Work on on board amp / audio out
	Make schematic for input filters

Tyler:
	Work on charging circuit

Tsegaslase:
	Finish block diagram (HW #5)
